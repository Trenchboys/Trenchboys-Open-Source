This is an Open Source Public Domain Project for developing free 3D printed miniatures with a World War One Sci-fi Theme.


Main Goal
_______________________________

The main directive is cultivating a library of .STL files that people can create miniatures at home with the help of a 3D printer.
These files are provided for free and can be used for any and all purposes. There are no limitations to their usage indicated by the CC-0 license.


Software
_______________________________

The recommended software for designing the 3D models is Blender. Contributors can use the .Blend source-file to make variations to the model.
This is open-source free to use 3D software and can be downloaded here. 
https://www.blender.org/

Software to presupport and slice the models for 3D printing can be any of the readily available slicing softwares.
A preference goes out to Lychee Slicer for its crucial ability to reload .stl files that are already supported.

Anyone is free to use the source files to create variations of the model and publish them to the repository.


Presupports
_______________________________
Preferably all contributed .STL files comes with a presupported file to save end users time and effort of having to support the files manually themselves.
Ofcourse people can contribute by pre-supporting models or improve on already pre-supported files.
